<h2>Focus on growing your sales... not managing your drop ship accounts</h2>

<p>Mothership lets you focus on the things that matter in your business by automating your drop ship operations and giving you the power to connect with an unlimited number of Shopify retailers in a private drop shipping network. That means there is a totally reliable, totally scalable solution to your problem of managing large, complicated, and diverse networks of drop shippers</p>

<h2>Private Dropshipping Networks</h2>

<p>When you connect to retailers with Mothership, you form a private drop shipping network that <I>you</I> control. Unlike social networks where everybody can connect to everybody else, the retailers in your private drop shipping network are connected only to you, have access to the products and pricing that you make available to them, and automatically send you orders when they sell one of your items<p> 

<p>Adding retailers to your network is as simple as sending them an invitation through Mothership. They connect to your store using our <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/mothership-connect">Retailer app</a> which enables them to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Browse product catalogs that you've published</li>
<li>Import products from catalogs to their store</li>
<li>Set their retail markup</li>
<li>View their drop ship orders</li>
<li>Pay invoices</li>
<li>Process returns</li>
</ul>
<p>Mothership makes establishing and maintaining drop ship relationships so easy with its suite of automation functions that it doesn't just reduce the time it takes to administer a drop ship network, it will actually help you sell <I>more</I> because of how easy it is for retailers to join your network, interact with you, import products from your inventory, and send you orders</p>

<h2>Mothership helps you drive growth in your drop ship channel!</h2>

<ul>
<li>Streamline operations across your supply chain: Connect to retailers in a private drop shipping network and publish customized inventory feeds with just a few clicks</li>

<li>Growth, not grind: Don't spend another minute managing drop ship inventory. Mothership keeps everyone updated with your current inventory levels and latest imagery, descriptions, etc., all synced in real-time across your network</li>

<li>All your drop ship orders in your Shopify dashboard: Mothership routes drop ship orders from every store in your network to your Shopify order feed for fulfillment so everyone stays organized and in control</li>

<li>Wholesale pricing: exert fine control over wholesale pricing and create multiple pricing tiers as unique as your trading partners</li>

<li>Bill trading partners for each order or extend terms: Either way, Mothership lets you manage accounts, invoice and pay all from within your Shopify dashboard!</li>

<li>Easy to set up, easy to use: Since Mothership runs inside your Shopify dashboard so its incredibly reliable and uses a familiar interface that suppliers and retailers can master with minimal training (which we provide, of course)</li>
