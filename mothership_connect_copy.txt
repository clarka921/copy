# Focus on growing your Shopify drop ship operations, not managing them 

Mothership Connect lets you focus on the things that matter in your business by automating your drop ship operations and giving you the power to connect to other Shopify merchants and sell their products from your store

# What does Mothership do?
Mothership lets Shopify stores connect together to form private drop shipping networks. Stores on the network act as suppliers or retailers, and access the network through separate apps. Suppliers offer their inventory to retailers and manage orders using the Supplier app; Retailers add products from suppliers and manage orders using the Retailer app

This simple relationship lies at the heart of Mothership, and coupled with a suite of automation functions gives you the unparalleled reach and efficiency to grow your drop ship channel sales- all in a cheap to deploy and simple to use app. Pretty cool, huh?

# How can my business use Mothership?

Suppliers -> Mothership -> Retailers -> Customers

Suppliers: Sell your inventory anywhere in your private drop shipping network. Connect to retailers through Mothership and publish catalogs of products they can add to their stores. Any updates you make to a product, like changing the description or adding a new image,  are applied by Mothership throughout your network, so every one always stays up to date and happy

Retailers: Choose which products to add to your store from suppliers and set your markup.  No matter which supplier a product comes from (or which retailer it is sold through), Mothership always routes it to the right supplier for fulfillment

Customers: Ahh, the lifeblood of every business. Mothership's private drop shipping networks help Shopify stores solve the crucial problem of being able to offer them what they want, where they want it. When you've got that, you've got growth Simple, right? 

# Mothership helps you drive growth in your drop ship channel!

* Streamline operations across your supply chain: Connect to other Shopify merchants in a private drop shipping network and add their products to your store with a few clicks

* Growth, not grind: Don't spend another minute managing drop ship inventory. Mothership keeps everyone updated on inventory levels, imagery, and descriptions, all synced in real-time across your network

* Manage drop ship orders from your Shopify dashboard:  Mothership routes drop ship orders to the right suppliers and always keeps you updated on fulfillment status

* Easy to set up, easy to use: Mothership runs inside your Shopify dashboard and was designed for simplicity and ease-of-use so anyone can use it with minimal training (which we provide, of course)
