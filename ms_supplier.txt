Detailed Description1	"<h2>Focus on <I>growing</I> your Shopify drop ship operations, not managing them</h2>
<p>Mothership lets you focus on the things that matter in your business by automating your drop ship operations and giving you the power to drop ship with an unlimited number of Shopify vendors in a private drop shipping network</p>"	 318 
Detailed Description2	"<h2>Private Dropshipping Networks</h2>
<p>When you connect to vendors with Mothership, you form a private drop shipping network that you control. Unlike social networks where everybody can connect to everybody else, the vendors in your private drop shipping network are connected only to you, have access to the products and pricing that you make available to them, and automatically send you orders when they sell one of your items<p> 
<p>Adding vendors to your network is as simple as sending them an invitation through Mothership. They connect to you using our <a href=""https://apps.shopify.com/mothership-connect"">Vendor app</a> which enables them to add your inventory to their store, set their retail markup, manage drop ship orders, pay invoices and more</p>"	 765 
	"<ul>
<li>Browse product catalogs that you've published</li>
<li>Add items from catalogs to their store</li>
<li>Set their retail markup</li>
<li>View their drop ship orders</li>
<li>Pay invoices</li>
<li>Process returns</li>
</ul>

<p>Mothership makes establishing and maintaining drop ship relationships so easy with its suite of automation functions that it doesn't just reduce the time it takes to administer a drop ship network, it will actually help you sell <I>more</I> because of how easy it is for vendors to join your network, interact with you, pull from your inventory, and send you orders</p>"	 604
