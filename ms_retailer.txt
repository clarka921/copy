"<h2>Focus on <I>selling more product</i>... not managing your suppliers</h2>
<p>Mothership lets you focus on the things that matter in your business by automating your drop ship operations and giving you the power to drop ship from an unlimited number of Shopify suppliers in a private drop shipping network</p>"
"# What does Mothership do?
<p>Mothership lets Shopify stores connect together to form private drop shipping networks. Stores on the network act as Suppliers by creating product feeds and fulfilling orders; and Retailers by accepting product feeds and adding Supplier inventory to their site. <a href=""https://apps.shopify.com/mothership"">Mothership for Suppliers</a>and Mothership for Retailers</p>
<p>Both apps run seamlessly in the Shopify dashboard and work together to form your private drop shipping network. Combined with a suite of automation functions, Mothership gives you unparalleled reach and efficiency to grow drop ship channel sales- whether you sell wholesale, retail, or both. Pretty cool, huh?</p>"


"# How can my business use Mothership for Dropship Vendors?
<p>Mothership's private drop shipping networks help Shopify stores solve the crucial problem of being able to offer customers what they want, where they want it. When you've got that, you've got growth! Simple, right?</p>
<p>On our Basic Retail Plan, connect with up to 10 other Shopify stores and add up to 300 products from their inventories to your store. Control your pricing and pay suppliers using your Shopify payment account. Every time you sell a product added from one of your suppliers, Mothership will create a drop ship order and send it to your supplier's Shopify dashboard for fulfillment. Mothership can even notify you and your and customers of changes in fulfillment status. Add new suppliers with a few clicks and begin doing business immediately. And if you ever need to drop a supplier, Mothership will make sure to delete all their products from your inventory.</p>"
