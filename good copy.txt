https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_data_interchange

EDI and other similar technologies save a company money by providing an alternative to, or replacing, information flows that require a great deal of human interaction and paper documents.

EDI and similar technologies allow a company to take advantage of the benefits of storing and manipulating data electronically without the cost of manual entry

Another advantage of EDI is the opportunity to reduce or eliminate manual data entry errors, such as shipping and billing errors, because EDI eliminates the need to rekey documents on the destination side.

One very important advantage of EDI over paper documents is the speed in which the trading partner receives and incorporates the information into their system thus greatly reducing cycle times. For this reason, EDI can be an important component of just-in-time production systems.[5]

According to the 2008 Aberdeen report "A Comparison of Supplier Enablement around the World", only 34% of purchase orders are transmitted electronically in North America. In EMEA, 36% of orders are transmitted electronically and in APAC, 41% of orders are transmitted electronically. They also report that the average paper requisition to order costs a company $37.45 in North America, $42.90 in EMEA and $23.90 in APAC. With an EDI requisition to order costs are reduced to $23.83 in North America, $34.05 in EMEA and $14.78 in APAC.

Brick & Click Store: A retail outlet or business with at least one physical location and at least one ecommerce enabled website.

Brick & Mortar Store: A retail outlet or business with at least one physical location.

Comma Separated Values (CSV): A file type that stores data values. CSV files are often used to transfer product feeds.

Content Management System (CMS): A software solution that makes it possible to create, edit, maintain, publish, and display content on the Internet from a single interface or administration tool. In the online retailing context, a CMS may be used to manage a stores product catalog.

Distributor: A distribution business that inventories products from a number of manufacturers and sells to many retailers. Often distributors are able to offer shorter lead times than manufacturers and may sell in smaller quantities. It is common for distributors to charge a premium over a manufacturer-direct price for the service and convenience provided.

Dropshipping / Drop Shipping: A fulfillment strategy wherein the retailer does not actually inventory the drop shipped product, but instead passes the shipping address to either the manufacturer, or a distributor that actually ships the purchased items directly to the customer. 

Ecommerce: Buying and selling products over electronic networks, including the Internet or mobile applications. The term may apply specifically to electronic transactions or more generally to the online retailing and online business.

Manufacturer: A company that makes goods for the purpose of sale

Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP): The price at which a manufacturer recommends that retailers sell a given product.

MAP Pricing: Manufacturers may require retailers to sell or advertise a given product at a minimum price. This price floor is known as a minimum advertised price or a minimum acceptable price. Manufacturers vary in their MAP enforcement, with some cancelling retail dealer agreements, if sellers offer products below MAP.

Net Terms: Credit term that a supplier extends to a retailer, allowing the retailer to pay for purchased items some number of days after those items have been shipped. Often net terms are described as “net 30,” “net 120,” or similar where net 30 means that a retailer has 30 days to pay for an order after that order has shipped. Frequently, net terms will also include a discount so that 5/10 net 30 would mean that a retailer would receive a 5-percent discount if the bill was paid in 10 days or less, otherwise the bill is due in 30 days. 

Retailer: A company that sells directly to the end consumer.

Supply Chain: A network or system of businesses involved in moving a product from its manufacturing point to the customer. In online retailing, the supply chain usually represents the distributor and manufacturer of a product.	

Vertical: An industry segment made up of similar business and customers.

We are pleased to announce a new drop shipping program with direct integration for retailers who want to sell our products on their website. Although we have been already providing a drop ship program for several years for some of our clients, this new portal will allow retailers to connect directly their e-commerce store with our back-end, meaning it will be very easy for new/existing customers to import product listings to their store, get real-time inventory and place orders with competitive pricing. Our portal is transparent throughout the entire process - from the PO to the shipping notice and tracking number.

GFURN.com is a multi-channel e-commerce furniture/lightings/home decor accessories company. We operate with 3 divisions: B2C (with our own e-commerce store), Wholesale (for interior designers, architects and brick & mortar retailers) and Dropshipping.

From our warehouse located in Montreal, Quebec, we ship on a daily basis to Canada and the US.

From DuoPlane job posting...

Can you tell me about Duoplane?

Duoplane is a SaaS software company for managing ecommerce operations. We work with large and growing ecommerce merchants who run their ecommerce presence on platforms such as Shopify, BigCommerce, and Magento.

What makes our clients unique is that they do not manage their own inventory. Instead, they work with outside fulfillment partners such as 3PLs (warehouses) and drop ship suppliers. It’s a model that more and more merchants are adopting to be more nimble, efficient, and focused on their core business.

Managing that kind of a fulfillment network is complex and painful. That’s where Duoplane comes in. We help merchants seamlessly integrate with their external fulfillment partners by routing order information, syncing inventory data, and much more. Our goal is to help ecommerce retailers work with their external fulfillment partners as if they were part of the same company.

We are bootstrapped, profitable, and growing. We are a 100% distributed team and believe in creating a flexible and inclusive environment that allows our team members to shine and do their best work.

We love exceeding expectations and wowing our clients and partners. We strive to push the envelope on everything we do; if it “can’t be done”, then we want to do it. We are looking for someone who shares this passion and wants to come help us support our customers better.
