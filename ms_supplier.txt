Detailed Description2	"<h2>Private Dropshipping Networks</h2>
<p>When you connect to vendors with Mothership, you form a private drop shipping network that you control. Unlike social networks where everybody can connect to everybody else, the vendors in your private drop shipping network are connected only to you, have access to the products and pricing that you make available to them, and automatically send you orders when they sell one of your items<p> 
<p>Adding vendors to your network is as simple as sending them an invitation through Mothership. They connect to you using our <a href=""https://apps.shopify.com/mothership-connect"">Vendor app</a> which enables them to add your inventory to their store, set their retail markup, manage drop ship orders, pay invoices and more</p>"	 765
